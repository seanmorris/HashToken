HashToken is a PHP class for generating expiring tokens. The class does not
rely on the database, rather it uses simple mathematics and the current time on
the local server to work out whether a token has expired or not.

The class uses SHA256 hashing along with a secret key to keep things secure. You
should change the KEY constant before using the code.

The tokens are plaintext, and can be passed to the user for example when a form
page is generated. When the form is posted, the server may check is the token is
still valid, ensuring the form was submitted in the allotted timeframe.

This all happens without any storage of tokens on the server side whatsoever.

The class has two functions, GetToken and CheckToken:

GetToken takes 2 or 3 parameters, they are UserKey, ExpireTime, and EmergeTime.
GetToken returns a string representing the token.

	UserKey
		- Secret key for this particular token.
		- Necesary to determine token validity.
		-May be NULL (must then also be NULL on CheckToken)

	ExpireTime - Validity time of token in seconds
			- If Emerge Time is set, this begins AFTER emerge time

	EmergeTime - Time in seconds to wait before considereing token valid

CheckToken takes two parameters, they are Token and UserKey
CheckToken returns a boolean indicating whether or not the token is currently valid.

	Token
		-The token generated by GetToken

	UserKey
		-The UserKey passes into GetToken. May Be NULL.
